Hi, I'm Mizzle, former heroin addict
Coke head, crack fiend
Man if killa had it, I tried it
If I itch he scratch, yo no homo man

But I part of the diplomats now
Yeah, you know the Byrd gang dip set bitch
So I'd like to welcome you to purple haze the album
Yeah my man killa's a mother fucker
I mean, he brings out the best in you
If you rap, you better spit that shit
'N you better sell that shit

If you steal, don't rob a store, rob the stash house
"George its 200 bricks in there stupid"
Ha that's what he told George man
What up oh yeah
If you sellin' nickels n dimes
Then you're nickel n dimin'
Get some weight on you like that fat bitch delaresse

I, I still don't know what that means man but
But I do know what this means
You get high, get high all the way
You sniff coke, fuck it, smoke crack
Don't stop there, if you smoke crack, shoot dope
If you shoot dope, sniff meth
He had all that shit right there for sale man
Funny mother fucker
