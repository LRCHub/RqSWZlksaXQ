DJ, DJ, prime club minister play my track cause the beat is sinister,
DJ, DJ, prime club minister play my track cause the beat is sinister,
Strobe light, blink, b-b-blink blink,
I feel like somebody roofied my drink d-d-drink drink
Dance floor politics, asses out, asses out,
Ya shorty youz about to get worked the fuck out

Some bitches came, some bitches conquered,
Some bitches got laid down in the slaughter,
Bad motherfucker, b-bad motherfucker,
What a sad motherfucker, let me duff this motherfucker,

Pretty girls, pretty girls travel in packs,
So all you bitch-made niggas stop talking back,
So all you bitch made niggas better count your stacks,
So all you bitch-made niggas better watch your backs,

It's a war out here, the real vs. the gimmicks,
The all wanna be stars but they heart ain't in it,
They all wanna go far but it's survival of the fittest,
So a spitta killa likes me comes around and fucking ends it,

See it in 'er eyes, cats wanna play,
Let me roll the dice, see what I can lay,
Lady feeling right, see what I can slay,
Haze Boogie Life, fiends like to walla, gullies like to walla
See it in 'er eyes, cats wanna play,
Let me roll the dice, see what I can lay,
Lady feeling right, see what I can slay,
Haze Boogie Life, fiends like to walla, gullies like to walla

(Where she come from?) How this bitch gettin here?
What this faggot doin here?
Sludge fucker listen 'er,
Attack from the back,
Ima leap from your sleep,
Somebody get me a staff so I can heard these fuckin sheep.

When my shit drop, it hits the 6 million circulation,
Illuminati who? Illuminati nation.
The great white hype, yes Ms. Blanco,
Got all these cats shook from LA to Toronto,
Got all my flights booked Capetown to London,
Paris and Geneva, Tokyo to Compton.
The thriller and vanilla,
Laid em countin scrilla,
Only top biller,
Only rocks my nigga,
Ya we rock my nigga,
To the top we'll figure,
The great white hype,
Yah Ms. Blanco game killer.
(I think they forgot what this shit supposed to sound like)

See it in 'er eyes, cats wanna play,
Let me roll the dice, see what I can lay,
Lady feeling right, see what I can slay,
Haze Boogie Life, fiends like to walla, gullies like to walla
See it in 'er eyes, cats wanna play,
Let me roll the dice, see what I can lay,
Lady feeling right, see what I can slay,
Haze Boogie Life, fiends like to walla, gullies like to walla
