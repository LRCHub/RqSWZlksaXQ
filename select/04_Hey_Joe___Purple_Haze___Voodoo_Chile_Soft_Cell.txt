Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
I'm going down to shoot my lady
Caught her messing 'round with another man
I'm going to shoot my lady
Caught her messing 'round with another man

Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
Hey Joe, I heard you shot her down, shot her down, down to the ground
Yes I did, I shot her
I caught her messing 'round, messing 'round town
Yes I did, I shot her
I caught her messing 'round, Messing 'round town
I shot her in the head
Yes I shot her, I shot her
I caught her messing round town
So I shot her

Hey Joe, where you gonna run to, run to now?
Hey Joe, where you gonna run to?
You better run, you better run
You better run, run, run

I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, to Mexico way
You ain't gonna get me
No one's gonna put a rope around me
Yea, you ain't gonna get me
No one's gonna put a rope around me

Purple haze, in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Acting funny but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple Haze all around
Don't know if I'm coming up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is that girl put a spell on me

Purple haze all in my eyes
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowing, blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?

Purple haze
Purple haze
Purple haze
Purple haze
Its blowing my mind
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?

Purple haze
Purple haze
Purple haze
Purple haze
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?
